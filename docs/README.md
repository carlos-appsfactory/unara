# Documentation Organization

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── database-implementation.md          # Data layer only
├── authentication-implementation.md    # Auth services & security
├── api-implementation.md              # Controllers & endpoints (future)
├── middleware-implementation.md       # Guards, interceptors (future)
└── testing-implementation.md         # Testing infrastructure (cross-cutting)
```

## Scope Separation

- **Database**: Entities, migrations, connections, data persistence
- **Authentication**: Services, validation, security rules, hashing
- **API**: Controllers, DTOs, request/response handling
- **Middleware**: Guards, interceptors, pipes, authentication flow
- **Testing**: Test infrastructure, patterns, tools (references other docs)

## File Reference Strategy

- Each doc only references files within its scope
- Modified files: document only the new parts added
- Cross-references between docs when needed
- Keep explanations essential - what it does, not how it works

## Benefits

Clear separation of concerns, easy to find relevant info, scales with project growth, prevents documentation bloat.
