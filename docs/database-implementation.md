# Database Implementation Documentation

## PostgreSQL Database Foundation

The Unara application now has a complete PostgreSQL database foundation with authentication capabilities.

## User Account System

A comprehensive user account system has been implemented with all necessary fields for user authentication and management:

- **User Identification**: Each user gets a unique identifier that never changes
- **Login Credentials**: Users can log in with either email address or username, both must be unique
- **Password Security**: User passwords are properly secured and never stored in plain text
- **Email Verification**: System tracks whether users have verified their email addresses
- **Profile Information**: Users can have a full name and profile picture
- **Activity Tracking**: System records when users last logged in
- **Automatic Timestamps**: All user accounts automatically track when they were created and last updated

*File: `src/users/entities/user.entity.ts` - Enhanced with authentication fields including password_hash, email_verified, last_login, and PostgreSQL-compatible UUID generation*

## Database Migration System

A proper database migration system is now in place that allows:

- **Version Control**: Database structure changes are tracked and versioned
- **Safe Updates**: Database can be updated safely without losing data
- **Rollback Capability**: Changes can be reversed if needed
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple developers can apply the same database changes

*Files:*
- *`src/database/migrations/1703000001000-CreateUsersTable.ts` - Complete migration creating users table with PostgreSQL-specific features like UUID generation and proper constraints*
- *`src/database/data-source.ts` - TypeORM configuration for running migrations with environment-based settings*

## Database Connection and Configuration

The application connects securely to PostgreSQL database with:

- **Environment-based Configuration**: Database settings can be changed without touching code
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of database connection issues
- **Logging**: Database operations can be logged for debugging when needed

*Files:*
- *`src/app.module.ts` - Updated to use migrations instead of synchronize and removed non-existent module references*
- *`.env` and `.env.template` - Comprehensive database and authentication environment configuration*

## Testing Infrastructure

Comprehensive testing system ensures database reliability:

- **Automated Testing**: Database functionality is automatically verified
- **Real Database Testing**: Tests run against actual PostgreSQL database, not fake systems
- **Migration Testing**: Database structure changes are thoroughly tested
- **Performance Validation**: Database operations are tested for speed and efficiency
- **Data Integrity Testing**: Ensures user data remains consistent and accurate

*Files:*
- *`src/users/entities/user.entity.spec.ts` - Comprehensive User entity tests with PostgreSQL testcontainers covering UUID generation, constraints, and authentication fields*
- *`src/database/database-connection.spec.ts` - Integration tests for TypeORM PostgreSQL connection, entity recognition, and CRUD operations*
- *`src/database/migrations/migration-rollback.spec.ts` - Migration rollback tests ensuring safe database structure changes and data integrity*
- *`package.json` - Added testcontainers dependencies and migration command scripts*

## Current Status

The database foundation is fully operational and ready for application development. All core user management functionality is in place and thoroughly tested.
